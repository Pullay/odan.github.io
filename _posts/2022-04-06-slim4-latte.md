## Introduction

Latte is a template engine for PHP that comes with 
[context-aware escaping](https://latte.nette.org/en/safety-first#toc-context-aware-escaping)
to protect against XSS vulnerabilities. 
I would like to take a closer look at this engine and see how this
interesting feature works.

## Installation

You can download the package using Composer:

```php
composer require latte/latte
```

## Configuration

Create a new directory `templates` in your project root directory.
All templates will be placed there later.

Add a new `template` configuration key in your `config/defaults.php` file: 

```php
$settings['template'] = __DIR__ . '/../templates';
```

Latte "compiles" the templates to native PHP code and stores them in 
a cache on the disk. So they are as fast as if they 
had been written in native PHP.

Add a new `template_temp` configuration key in your `config/defaults.php` file:
Make sure the directory `{project}/tmp/templates` exists and has read and write access permissions.

```php
$settings['template_temp'] = __DIR__ . '/../tmp/templates';
```

Latte automatically regenerates the cache every time you 
change the template, which can be turned off in the 
production environment to save a little performance:

```php
// change to false in the production environment
$settings['template_auto_refresh'] = true;
```

Next, add a DI container definitions for the `Latte\Engine` class.

```php
<?php

use Latte\Engine;
use Latte\Loaders\FileLoader;
use Psr\Container\ContainerInterface;
// ...

return [

    // ...
    
    Engine::class => function (ContainerInterface $container) {
        $latte = new Engine();
        $settings = $container->get('settings');
        $latte->setLoader(new FileLoader($settings['template']));
        $latte->setTempDirectory($settings['template_temp']);
        $latte->setAutoRefresh($settings['template_auto_refresh']);

        return $latte;
    },
];
```

This alone would technically work to render a latte template,
but we also need to make it work with the PSR-7 response object.

For this purpose we create a special `TemplateRenderer` 
class which does this work for us.

So next create a file in `src/Renderer/TemplateRenderer.php` and copy/paste this code:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Renderer;

use Latte\Engine;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;

final class TemplateRenderer
{
    private Engine $engine;

    public function __construct(Engine $engine)
    {
        $this->engine = $engine;
    }

    public function template(
        ResponseInterface $response,
        string $template,
        array $data = []
    ): ResponseInterface {
        $string = $this->engine->renderToString($template, $data);
        $response->getBody()->write($string);

        return $response;
    }
}
```

## Usage

Instead of using the Latte Engine object directly we use the `TemplateRenderer` object
to render the template into a PSR-7 compatible object.

A typical Action handler class might look like this to render a template with the name `home.latte`:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Action\Home;

use App\Renderer\TemplateRenderer;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;

final class HomeAction
{
    private TemplateRenderer $renderer;

    public function __construct(TemplateRenderer $renderer)
    {
        $this->renderer = $renderer;
    }

    public function __invoke(
        ServerRequestInterface $request,
        ResponseInterface $response
    ): ResponseInterface {
        $viewData = [
            'items' => ['one', 'two', 'three'],
        ];

        return $this->renderer->template($response, 'home.latte', $viewData);
    }
}

```

To make it work, create a template file in `templates/home.latte` with this content:

```html
<ul n:if="$items">
    {foreach $items as $item}
        <li id="item-{$iterator->counter}">{$item|capitalize}</li>
    {/foreach}
</ul>
```

If everything is configured correctly you should see the following output:

* One
* Two
* Three


## Escaping Output

The most important task of a template system is to avoid
security vulnerabilities. 

The Latte `Context-Aware Escaping` technologie recognizes 
the context in which the tag is placed and chooses the right escaping mode.

The output varies depending on whether you 
output the data within an HTML tag, an HTML attribute, 
or within JavaScript.

Let's take for example this template:

```html
<p onclick="alert({$movie})">{$movie}</p>

<script>var movie = {$movie};</script>
```

If the variable `$movie` contains `Amarcord & 8 1/2`, the generated 
result looks like this:

```html
<p onclick="alert(&quot;Amarcord &amp; 8 1\/2&quot;)">Amarcord &amp; 8 1/2</p>

<script>var movie = "Amarcord & 8 1\/2";</script>
```

Thanks to Context-Aware Escaping the template is simple 
and your protected against Cross-Site Scripting.

## Conclusion

Compared to Twig, the syntax looks more lightweight, cleaner and is easier to learn.
I guess more designers are familiar with Twig then with Latte templates.
Latte is flexible enough for most use cases, but Twig might be more extensible 
and has bigger community and support behind it. 

When it comes to security, Latte has some very good features enabled.
Twig also provides a so-called "Automatic output escaping" feature, 
but this however, must be manually written in a block of code.

To achieve the best speed possible, Latte compiles templates down 
to native PHP code. So performance wise Latte should be at the same
level as Twig.

If a Latte file contains an error, the error message may not be
clear in all cases. Therefore, debugging can sometimes be a bit
time-consuming, but the community is very polite and helpful.
