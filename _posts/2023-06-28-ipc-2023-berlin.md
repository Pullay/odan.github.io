From May 23-25, 2023, I had the opportunity to attend the 
[International PHP Conference](https://phpconference.com/) in Berlin.

The various talks covered a wide range of topics, including the latest trends and technologies in the PHP ecosystem, 
best practices in software architecture, effective testing strategies, and performance improvements.

One of the highlights of my visit was the opportunity to meet new people from the PHP community. 
Meeting [Roland Golla](https://phpconference.com/speaker/roland-golla/) (Never Code Alone) was particularly impressive. 
We had the chance to discuss current trends in web development and gain valuable 
insights into the challenges and opportunities in the industry. 
Networking provided a great opportunity to make connections and gain new perspectives.
