**Exciting News!**

I am excited to announce that I have joined the Slim Framework organization on GitHub! 

Slim Framework is a well-known PHP micro-framework that I have admired and worked with extensively. Being part of this organization is a great honor and an incredible opportunity to contribute to a project that I really like.

I'm looking forward to collaborating with the Slim Framework community, contributing to the project, and helping maintain its repositories. This is a wonderful chance to work alongside talented developers and enhance a framework that many in the PHP community rely on.

*PS: Open-source contributions are a great way to improve your skills, collaborate with other developers, and give back to the community.*
