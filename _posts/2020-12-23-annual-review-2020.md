The year 2020 was very exciting and I would like to share some positive 
moments with you.

### Publications and Interviews

I have been dreaming about it for a long time. 
In May 2020 the german PHP-Magazin published an article I wrote about the topic 
[Slim 4 Framework](https://entwickler.de/online/php/cms-neu-im-kiosk-php-magazin-4-20-579934160.html).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="de" dir="ltr">CMS: Ein Markt im Umbruch, Slim 4 Framework, Websites testen – Neu im Kiosk: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PHP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PHP</a> Magazin 4.20<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/slimframework?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#slimframework</a><a href="https://t.co/uAvQy1zspO">https://t.co/uAvQy1zspO</a></p>&mdash; Daniel Opitz (@dopitz) <a href="https://twitter.com/dopitz/status/1263006392392101888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

After that I was interviewed about [the pros and cons of Slim 4](https://entwickler.de/online/php/php-microframework-slim-579928772.html)
by the PHP Magazine.

For the french magazine [programmez!](https://www.programmez.com/) I had the pleasure to
review this article from Thierry Leriche: [À la découverte de Slim 4](https://www.programmez.com/magazine/article/la-decouverte-de-slim-4).

I published my **[Slim 4 eBook](https://odan.github.io/donate.html)** with over 270 pages
of knowledge about web development, architecture, databases and best practices.

### Conferences

Since 2014 I regularly attend the International PHP Conference in Munich and Berlin. 
In 2020, I attended this conference online for the first time. 
My experience with it was quite positive. Unfortunately, of course, 
you don't have the opportunity to meet old friends or meet new people directly.

### PHP 8

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/781074/103037678-b4fa0200-456c-11eb-8984-73c2381ec18a.png)

PHP 8 has been released.

The upgrade to PHP 8.0 is quite easy and has already been completed for some of my 
components.

My impression is that PHP is on the advance again and is getting better with every release.
In the near future, we will probably see more syntactic sugar that might remind us of JavaScript.
Performance will continue to improve as well,
but in smaller steps than it was the case from PHP 5 to PHP 7.

[Generic arrays](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/generic-arrays) is a feature that is still missing in PHP.

### Brief conclusion

I am looking forward to the next year and wish you a happy and successful New Year 2021. 

Stay healthy.
