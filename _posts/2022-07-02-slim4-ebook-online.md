I must say that I am really pleasantly surprised by the success of the 
Slim 4 eBook. Many developers who want to get to learn more about 
the Slim framework or want to improve their expertise in 
web development have already bought this eBook. 

Almost daily I update parts of the content or even write new articles for it. 
As a buyer you also get a link with the current version. 
Due to the high update rate, I decided to put an HTML version of it online, 
in addition to the PDF and EPUB format. 
This should make it even easier to read the current content directly in the browser.

For this purpose I integrated the Ko-Fi Shop and the Stripe API into 
the ordering process. This means that you will now get a link to 
the new eBook online portal directly after the checkout process. 

For the future I also plan the possibility to unlock single articles there. 
In addition, I will log all changes and enhancements in a changelog file. 

If you have already purchased this eBook I can send you a link via email. 
Please just contact me.
