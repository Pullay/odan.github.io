## Introduction

The HTTP protocol is great for transferring small amounts of data very quickly.
That's why most people prefer RESTful APIs for communication between servers.

You have to distinguish between small amounts of data that are transferred 
immediately and large amounts of data that are transferred with a time delay.

HTTP works very well as long as the amount of data is very small (< 5 MB) 
and there are no network timeouts.

In some rare use cases you may need to transfer more than 5 MB at once 
over the wire in a more delayed fashion, for example once a day or so. 
Then it would make sense to think about a specialized "file transfer protocol", 
like SFTP (FTP over SSH).

SFTP or Secure File Transfer Protocol is also known as SSH File Transfer Protocol. 
It is a network protocol to be able to transfer files to remote systems.

SFTP allows companies to securely transfer billing and financial data or files 
for disaster recovery, for example. SFTP relies on SSH (Secure Shell) to transfer data. 
The client must authenticate itself to the server. Commands and data are encrypted. 
In this way, passwords and other sensitive information are not sent over the network 
in plain text and thus cannot be read or sniffed out.

SFTP was developed by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) to allow 
files to be transferred and managed securely over TCP/IP networks. 

SFTP uses the same commands as the traditional File Transfer Protocol (FTP).

## Installation

The [Flysystem SFTP Adapter](https://flysystem.thephpleague.com/v2/docs/adapter/sftp/)
provides a powerful filesystem and SFTP abstraction and uses
[Phpseclib](https://github.com/phpseclib/phpseclib) to provide a convenient interface 
for SFTP file transfers.

To install Flysystem, run:

```
composer require league/flysystem
```

Before using the [SFTP drivers](https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem-sftp),
you will need to install the appropriate package via the Composer package manager:

```
composer require league/flysystem-sftp
```

## Configuration

If you need to configure a SFTP filesystem, you may use the configuration example below:

```php
use League\Flysystem\PhpseclibV2\SftpAdapter;
use League\Flysystem\PhpseclibV2\SftpConnectionProvider;
use League\Flysystem\UnixVisibility\PortableVisibilityConverter;

// ...

$settings['sftp'] = [
    'adapter' => new SftpAdapter(
        new SftpConnectionProvider(
            'localhost',
            'username',
            'password',
        ),
        '/', // remote root path
        PortableVisibilityConverter::fromArray(
            [
                'file' => [
                    'public' => 0640,
                    'private' => 0604,
                ],
                'dir' => [
                    'public' => 0740,
                    'private' => 7604,
                ],
            ]
        )
    ),
];
```

## Container Setup

For [autowiring](https://php-di.org/doc/autowiring.html) I want to give the container a unique class name, because
I my projects I have multiple Filesystem adapters e.g. one for the local filesystem
and multiple SFTP adapters for other different servers. 
For this reason I extend a new class from `\League\Flysystem\Filesystem`. 
Then I add a container definition for that extended class, 
instead of using the too generic `\League\Flysystem\Filesystem` class. 
This allows you to explicitly declare the connection within the (service) class 
constructor and makes it possible to handle multiple different Filesystem 
"drivers" as simple as possible.

First create a new class in, `src/Filesystem/SftpFilesystem.php`.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Filesystem;

use League\Flysystem\Filesystem;

final class SftpFilesystem extends Filesystem
{
    // must be empty
}
```

You could also give the class a less-generic name. 
For example when you have multiple "clients" you could give them names 
like `AcmeSftpFilesystem`, `ContosoSftpFilesystem` etc.

Insert a DI container definition for the `SftpFilesystem:class` in `config/container.php`:

```php
<?php

use App\Filesystem\SftpFilesystem;
use League\Flysystem\Filesystem;
use Psr\Container\ContainerInterface;
// ...

return [

    // ...

    SftpFilesystem::class => function (ContainerInterface $container) {
        $sftp = $container->get('settings')['sftp'];

        return new SftpFilesystem($sftp['adapter']);
    },

];

```

## Usage

To get the `SftpFilesystem` instance via dependency injection, just declare it in
the constructor where you need it. Normally you should use the filesystem instance
only within a domain or application service.

**Example**

```php
<?php

namespace App\Domain\Example\Service;

use App\Filesystem\SftpFilesystem;

final class Example
{
    private SftpFilesystem $sftpFilesystem;

    public function __construct(SftpFilesystem $filesystem)
    {
        $this->sftpFilesystem = $filesystem;
    }

    public function foo(): void
    {
        // Reading a remote file
        $content = $this->sftpFilesystem->read('index.html');
        
        // ...
    }
}
```

**Downloading (reading) files**

Like writing a file, reading a file can be done in two ways. 
You can read the file contents in full as a string, or “stream” it by obtaining a resource. 
Using the resource allows you to stream the contents to a destination 
(local or to another filesystem) in order to keep memory usage low.

```php
$content = $this->sftpFilesystem->read('index.html');
```

**Uploading (writing) files**

```php
$this->sftpFilesystem->write('test.html', 'test');
```

**List (remote) files**

```php
use League\Flysystem\StorageAttributes;
use League\Flysystem\FileAttributes;
use League\Flysystem\DirectoryAttributes;
// ...

/** @var StorageAttributes $item */
$items = $this->sftpFilesystem->listContents('/');

foreach ($items as $item) {
    $path = $item->path();

    if ($item instanceof FileAttributes) {
        // handle the file
    }
    
    if ($item instanceof DirectoryAttributes) {
        // handle the directory
    }
}
```

For more information about the usage, check out the 
[Filesystem API](https://flysystem.thephpleague.com/v2/docs/usage/filesystem-api/) documentation.

## Conclusion

We have learned that, with a little trick, it's very easy to use the `league/flysystem`
package with multiple different Filesystem "drivers" in combination with an 
autowired DI container and dependency injection.
