I am excited to announce that I have just published a new video on my YouTube channel! 

In the video, I provide a detailed explanation of what a PSR-15 middleware is, 
how it works, and how it can be used in Slim Framework. 

I also include an example of of a logger middleware and demonstrate how 
it can be used to add functionality to web applications.

If you haven't already, be sure to check out my channel and watch the new video. 
I would love to hear your thoughts and feedback on it. 
And if you like it, don't forget to hit the like button and subscribe
